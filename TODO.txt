* Add imputation capability
* Add support for Jarvis-Patrick clustering
* Implement this method for HVG discovery: https://www-nature-com.proxy.kib.ki.se/articles/nmeth.2645#methods (requires ERCC genes)
* Add support for the LargeVis embedding method: https://github.com/lferry007/LargeVis
* Implement scrublet support: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/07/09/357368.full.pdf and https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/scrublet and https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/simpleSingleCell/inst/doc/doublets.html
* Add support for these graph clustering algorithms: spinglass, multilevel, infomap, fastgreedy, walktrap (all implemented in igraph: https://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html)
* top 10 genes
* constant colors
* number of expressed cells per cluster
* scrublet?
* also regular PCA in addition so singular value decomposition
